Personal website for Timothy Voice

## Goal

To create a personal website where I can host my CV, writings and projects

## Technology

I want to write in Markdown files and have them rendered and served as HTML pages on the web.
I want to use minimal styling (vanilla CSS and a good font).
I want to have github actions that deploy my website to fly.io when I push to the `main` branch on github.
I want to install web analytics from Fathom analytics to track website vists.
